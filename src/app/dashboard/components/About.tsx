            operations, enhance efficiency, and make our mark as we ventured
            into the Drug Manufacturing and White Labeling space. By
            consolidating our pharmacy operations under Sudhanand Pharmacies
            Pvt. Ltd., we aim to ensure consistent quality, competitive pricing,
